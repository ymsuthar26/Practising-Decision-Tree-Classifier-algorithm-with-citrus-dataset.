# Practising-Decision-Tree-Classifier-algorithm-with-citrus-dataset.
Trains and visualizes a Decision Tree Classifier on the Iris dataset using scikit-learn.
# Libraries Used
-pandas – for data manipulation and analysis
-numpy – for numerical operations
-matplotlib & seaborn – for data visualization
-sklearn.tree – for building and visualizing the decision tree
-sklearn.datasets – to load the Iris dataset
-sklearn.model_selection – for splitting the data into training and test sets
-sklearn.metrics – to evaluate model performance

# What the Code Does:
-Loads the citrus dataset
-Converts it into a DataFrame for easier handling
-Splits the data into training and test sets
-Trains a Decision Tree Classifier
-Evaluates model accuracy on both sets
-Visualizes the trained tree structure
